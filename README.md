# pcrappyfuzzer
Script to perform quick 'n dirty fuzzing of PCAPs with radamsa and Scapy.

pcrappyfuzzer.py: a very simple mash-up of Scapy + radamsa to extract data from pcap and perform fuzzing ad infinitum.

Originally written for a penetration testing engagement, but modified
to support the blog post "Fuzzing proprietary protocols with Scapy,
radamsa and a handful of PCAPs" published in https://blog.blazeinfosec.com
